* TODO:
** data validation
- drivers license
- age
- CLEANER USER INPUT, CHECKING DATA TYPES, ETC
- etc
** when displaying a rental, if returned is null, don't say null. say 'not returned' or something like that
** make it so a customer can only have x reservations at a time
* Employee interface
** menu:
*** list outstanding charges for your location
*** view user history
- rental and reservations
*** rent a car
*** return a car
- adding a charge to a customer
*** update a charge
*** view vehicles
- get number of vehicles. they may want to make a request for more vehicles
*** create customer
* manager interface
- no input needed
** menu:
*** view all unpaid charges
*** add a location
*** view all locations with the number of cars they have
- number out and total number
*** add cars
*** remove cars
- probably not a good idea because of FK constraint
*** move cars
- maybe
*** view unpaid charges for an individual user
* customer interface
** menu
*** edit profile
*** view user info
*** update user info



* RIGOROUSLY TEST PASSING BETWEEN FUNCTIONS BECAUSE SOME OF THE RECURSION MAY BE WEIRD AND PLACE YOU BACK INTO AN UNNATURAL METHOD IF A RETURN WAS DONE INCORRECTLY
