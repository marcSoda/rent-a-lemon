* Employee interface
** menu:
*** list outstanding charges for your location
*** view user history

- adding a charge to a customer
*** update a charge
*** view vehicles
- get number of vehicles. they may want to make a request for more vehicles
*** create customer
* manager interface

** menu:
*** view all unpaid charges
*** add a location
*** remove a location?
*** view all locations with the number of cars they have
- number out and total number

*** move cars
- maybe
*** view unpaid charges for an individual user
* customer interface
** menu
*** edit profile
